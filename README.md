# math-mountains

A game for practicing arithmetic, co-created with my daughter, based on 
an activity used for addition and substraction basics in her 2nd grade class.

This was created in Stencyl 2. Exporting a project from Stencyl seems to
dump a bunch of extraneous files into the source directory -- this should
probably be cleaned up at some point.
